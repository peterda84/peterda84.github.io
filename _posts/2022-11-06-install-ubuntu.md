I have always wanted to try some OS on my RPi 4 that is not Raspberry Pi OS. In this post I will show you how easy is to install Ubuntu Server on this hardware.

### Step1: Download the official Raspberry Pi Imager [from here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

### Step9: Click on the small gear icon on the left bottom for Advanced options. Modify the setting as your needs. I have enabled SSH and set a password since I use my Raspberry Pi as a headless server.

### Step 11: That's all, you can remove the SD card with the fresh OS installed on it. Insert it into the RPi and start to use.
